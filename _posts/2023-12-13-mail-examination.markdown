## How does spam affect us?  
An inexperienced and unsuspecting user in your corporate environment clicking on a link or downloading and running a malicious attachment can give an attacker a foothold on the network.  
Many products help fight spam and phishing, but sometimes these spam or phishing mails can get through.  
When this happens, as a Security Analyst, you need to analyze these emails.  
## The Email Address  
**Raymond Samuel Tomlinson** implemented the first email program on the ARPANET system. He was the first to use the @ sign to distinguish the user name from the machine name.  

what makes up an email address?  
- User Mailbox (or Username)  
- @  
- Domain  

## What if Email Delivery?  
There are 3 specific protocols for outgoing and incoming email messages. They are listed below:  
- SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) - It is utilized to handle the sending of emails.  
- POP3 (Post Office Protocol) - Is responsible transferring email between a client and a mail server.  
- IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) - Is responsible transferring email between a client and a mail server.  

POP3 and IMAP looks the same. But there are differences between the two.  
**What is these differences?**  
> POP3
> - Emails are downloaded and stored on a single device.  
> - Sent messages are stored on the single device from which the email was sent.  
> - Emails can only be accessed from the single device the emails were downloaded to.  

> IMAP
> - Emails are stored on the server and can be downloaded to multiple devices.  
> - Sent messages are stored on the server.  
> - Messages can be synced and accessed across multiple devices.
