## How does spam affect us?  
An inexperienced and unsuspecting user in your corporate environment clicking on a link or downloading and running a malicious attachment can give an attacker a foothold on the network.  
Many products help fight spam and phishing, but sometimes these spam or phishing mails can get through.  
When this happens, as a Security Analyst, you need to analyze these emails.  
## The Email Address  
**Raymond Samuel Tomlinson** implemented the first email program on the ARPANET system. He was the first to use the @ sign to distinguish the user name from the machine name.  

what makes up an email address?  
- User Mailbox (or Username)  
- @  
- Domain  

## What if Email Delivery?  
There are 3 specific protocols for outgoing and incoming email messages. They are listed below:  
- SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) - It is utilized to handle the sending of emails.  
- POP3 (Post Office Protocol) - Is responsible transferring email between a client and a mail server.  
- IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) - Is responsible transferring email between a client and a mail server.  

POP3 and IMAP looks the same. But there are differences between the two.  
**What is these differences?**  
> POP3
> - Emails are downloaded and stored on a single device.  
> - Sent messages are stored on the single device from which the email was sent.  
> - Emails can only be accessed from the single device the emails were downloaded to.  

> IMAP
> - Emails are stored on the server and can be downloaded to multiple devices.  
> - Sent messages are stored on the server.  
> - Messages can be synced and accessed across multiple devices.

## what makes up an email message?  
There are two parts to an email:  
-  the email header (information about the email, such as the email servers that relayed the email)
-  the email body (text and/or HTML formatted text)

üìù **Note:The syntax for email messages is known as the Internet Message Format (IMF).**

Let's start with the following email header fields:  
- From - the sender's email address
- Subject - the email's subject line
- Date - the date when the email was sent
- To - the recipient's email address


![email-headers-1b](https://github.com/3xg3lin/3xg3lin.github.io/assets/73038148/267042ae-3a56-4522-a56d-c2b01bb0840d)  

Now let's look email details.  
üìù **Note: Displaying raw/full email headers in various email clients may be different. For this, visit this [link](https://mediatemple.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204644060-how-do-i-view-email-headers-for-a-message)**.  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:Don't engage/interact with the email addresses or IP addresses.**

From the above image, there are other email header fields of interest.   
- X-Originating-IP - The IP address of the email was sent from (this is known as an X-header)
- Smtp.mailfrom/header.from - The domain the email was sent from (these headers are within Authentication-Results)
- Reply-To - This is the email address a reply email will be sent to instead of the From email address

[Here](https://mediatemple.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204643950-understanding-an-email-header) is an example from Media Temple on how to analyze emails.  

Now it's time to analyze the body of an email.  
The email body is the part of the email which contains the text (plain or HTML formatted) the sender wants you to view.

Above image is _text-only_ email.  
![mail](https://github.com/3xg3lin/3xg3lin.github.io/assets/73038148/25936cee-47cb-4934-a9de-572ccfceedc4)

Above image is HTML formatted email. And contains an image (which was blocked by the email client) and embedded hyperlinks.  
You can view an email's HTML code similar method.  
Image below is from Protonmail.

Lastly, emails may contain attachments. You can view an email's attachment from an email's HTML format or by viewing the source code.  

![email-with-attachment](https://github.com/3xg3lin/3xg3lin.github.io/assets/73038148/dd793ab5-52ff-4a98-ad33-5b94669b23bf)  
- The email body has an image.
- The email attachment is a PDF document.

Let's view this attachment within the source code.
