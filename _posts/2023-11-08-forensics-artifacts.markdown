## What is DFIR?  
DFIR stands for Digital Forensics and Incident Response. This area covers the collection of forensic artifacts and helps Security Experts identify footprints left by an attacker.  

## What is Artifacts?  
üìù **Note:Forensic artifacts are important pieces of information about human activity.**  
In computer forensics, these artifacts are pieces of evidence that point to an activity performed on a system.  

## So, the artifacts actually is evidence relevant to the investigation?  
No, it may or may not be related to the investigation.  

## How???  
Briefly, artifacts are objects that have a forensic value. It can be any object that contains some data or evidence of something that happened. We actually collect artifacts to support a hypothesis or claim about the attacker's activity. For example, at a crime scene, fingerprints, a broken button on a jacket are artifacts. In a Windows system, a person's actions can be traced quite accurately using forensics because of the various artifacts that a Windows system creates for a particular activity.  

## Is my computer spying on me?  
A Windows system keeps this track to improve the user's experience (At least that's what they say). Forensic investigators also use this tracked data as artifacts to identify activity on a system.

## What is Windows Registry?  
The Windows Registry is a collection of databases that store low-level settings for Windows to use. And The Windows registry consists of Keys and Values. 
-  **Registry Keys** are the folders you see in the regedit.exe utility.  
-  **Registry Values** are the data stored in these Registry Keys.  

## Windows hive? What is that?  
A **Registry Hive** is a group of Keys, subkeys and values stored in a single file on disk.  

## Structure of the Registry:
- `HKEY_CURRENT_USER`
- `HKEY_USERS`
- `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE`
- `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT`
- `HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG`  

If you want to know what all this section above means, you can check this [site](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/troubleshoot/windows-server/performance/windows-registry-advanced-users).
Up to this point, if you are in the live system, you can do all of this. But what if you are not?  

 üìù **Note:In that case we assume you have a disk image for sure**  

The majority of these hives are located in the `C:\Windows\system32\config` directory and are:
- DEFAULT (mounted on `HKEY_USERS\DEFAULT`) 
- SAM (mounted on `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SAM`)
- SECURITY (mounted on `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Security`)
- SOFTWARE (mounted on `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software`)
- SYSTEM (mounted on `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System`)

Apart from these hives, two other hives containing user information can be found in the User profile directory.  

- NTUSER.DAT (mounted on `HKEY_CURRENT_USER` when a user logs in) hive is located in the directory `C:\Users\<username>\. 
- USRCLASS.DAT (mounted on `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\CLASSES`) hive is located in the directory `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows`   

## What is Transaction Logs and Backups?  
We can say that ***transaction logs*** are the change log of the registry hive. Windows often uses transaction logs when writing data to registry hives. This means that the transaction logs can often have the latest changes in the registry that haven't made their way to the registry hives themselves. The transaction log for each hive is stored as a .LOG file in the same directory as the hive itself (like `SAM.LOG`). If there are multiple transaction logs, their extensions can be **.LOG1**, **.LOG2**. ***Registry backups*** are backups of registry hives located in the `C:\Windows\system32\config` directory. These hives are copied to the `C:\Windows\system32\config\RegBack` directory every ten days. Registry backups can be an excellent place to look for some registry keys that may have been deleted/modified.  

üìù **Note:You can use a live system or an image of the system to perform a forensic examination.**  
üí° **Tip:If we want to copy the registry hives from %WINDIR%\System32\Config, we cannot because it is a restricted file. For this you can use KAPE,FTK imager (FTK imager will not copy the Amcache.hve file) tools. In this case, we will use [Eric Zimmerman's tools](https://ericzimmerman.github.io/#!index.md) for live analysis.**  

### OS Version  
We can use the registry key `SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion` to find the operating system version.  

### Current control set  
Control sets are configuration data used to control the startup of the system. Usually we see two Control Sets, ControlSet001 points to the Control Set the machine booted with, and ControlSet002 is the last known good configuration. Their locations will be:  
+ SYSTEM\ControlSet001
+ SYSTEM\ControlSet002

And Windows creates a temporary Control Set called CurrentControlSet (`HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet`) when the machine is alive.  
We can find out which Control Set is used as CurrentControlSet by checking `SYSTEM\Select\Current`.  
Similarly, the `SYSTEM\Select\LastKnownGood` configuration can also be found.  

![CurrentControlSet](https://github.com/3xg3lin/3xg3lin.github.io/assets/73038148/8fb250ba-7968-4b30-bac2-154921b460f1)  

### Computer Name  
We can find the Computer Name from `SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\ComputerName\ComputerName`.  

### Time Zone Information  
We can check `SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\TimeZoneInformation` to find the Time Zone Information.  

### Network Interfaces and Past Networks  
The `SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\Interfaces` registry key will give a list of network interfaces on the machine.  

üí° **Tip: The past networks connected to the machine can be found in `SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\NetworkList\Signatures\Unmanaged` and `SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\NetworkList\Signatures\Managed`.**  

### Autostart Programs (Autoruns)  
The following registry keys include information about programs or commands that run when a user logs on.   
```
NTUSER.DAT\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
NTUSER.DAT\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\policies\Explorer\Run
SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
```


### UserAssist  
**User Assist** registry keys keep a record of applications started by the user. Information such as the programs launched, when they were launched and how many times they were run. And the User Assist key is present in the NTUSER hive. We can find it in `NTUSER.DAT\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Currentversion\Explorer\UserAssist\{GUID}\Count`.  

### ShimCache  
**ShimCache** is a mechanism used to keep track of application compatibility with the OS. It is also called Application Compatibility Cache (AppCompatCache). We can find it in `SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\AppCompatCache`.  

### AmCache  
AmCache stores information of executed applications. These executed applications include the execution path, the time of first execution, the time of deletion and the initial installation. This hive is located in the file system at `C:\Windows\appcompat\Programs\Amcache.hve`.  

### Device identification  
The following locations keep a record of USB keys plugged into a system. These locations store the vendor ID, the product ID, the version of the USB device, and the time the devices were plugged into the system.  
- `SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\USBSTOR`
- `SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\USB`  

Now let's give some examples.  
üí° Tip: I used Eric Zimmerman's Registry Explorer tool for this investigation.  

First I examining `SAM` File.  
![SAM](https://github.com/3xg3lin/3xg3lin.github.io/assets/73038148/903080e4-0466-4e58-a175-76350dda582c)  

Here we can see the user's relative identifier (RID), the user's login count, last login time, last failed login, last password change, password expiration, password policy and password hint, and the groups the user is part of.  

![RECENTFILES](https://github.com/3xg3lin/3xg3lin.github.io/assets/73038148/9244e8d2-f014-430d-a0eb-79a984c70a42)  

### Recent Files  
Windows maintains a list of recently opened files for each user. This information is stored in `NTUSER.DAT\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\RecentDocs`.  

We can also look at the UserAssist location.  
![userassist](https://github.com/3xg3lin/3xg3lin.github.io/assets/73038148/35d42a8f-3e73-46f9-b3cc-a429a90ff978)  


We mentioned UserAssist above. We can see the time when the application was started.
