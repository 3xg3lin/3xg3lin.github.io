*MITRE ATTA&CK* stands for *MITRE Adversarial Tactics,Techniques and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK)*. *MITRE ATTA&CK Framework* is knowledge base model for various malicious threats. This framework was created in 2013 by the *MITRE* corporation. Then this freamwork created based on real-world observations and it continues to evolve with the threat landscape.  

*MITRE ATTA&CK* Freamwork has tree main components:
- **Tactics**: This denotes the goals that the threat actor may want to achieve in order to attack the system.
- **Techniques**: This defines the ways that the threat actor uses to achieve tactical goals.
- The framework also contains documented details about previous usage of the techniques.

This Framework has different Matrices, and the most famous matrix is Enterprise Matrix. Enterprise Matrix describes the tactics and techniques used by threat actors against enterprise platforms.  

Some tactics mentioned under the Enterprise matrix are:
1. **Reconnaissance**: Covertly gathering information about a target or targets for planning an attack.
2. **Resource Development**: Deciding on information to carry out an attack.
3. **Initial Access**: Establishing an initial foothold over a system by gaining access.
4. **Execution**: Deployment of the tools to carry put the attack.
5. **Persistence**: maintaning presence over a network even if mitigation techniques have been employed.
6. **Privilege Escalation**: Getting much higher level controls such as administrator level or root level controls.
7. **Defense Evasion**: Attempting to bypass the security mechanisms implemented on the network for protection.
8. **Credential Access**: Gaining access to some important usernames and passwords.
9. **Discovery**: Trying to figure out the target environment.
10. **Lateral Movement**: It means going deep into the target network to get some sensitive information that could compromise the system.
11. **Collection**: Collecting of data about the target that can help to achieve a goal.
12. **Command & Control**: Once all kinds of access has been gained. Attacker uses this tactic to finally establish contol over the network or system.
13. **Exfiltration**: Stealing data from the compromised system.
14. **Impact**: Manipulation, interruption or destruction of system and the data inside.

Briefly, this framework is one such tool for individuals, organizations and governments to avoid their systems and networks becoming targets for malicious actors in cyberspace.
